Layout in Memory
****************

Hyperion reserves four 64-byte slots, with specific byte ranges (inclusive of endpoints) being used as follows:

- ``0x00`` - ``0x7f`` (128 bytes): scratch space for hashing methods
- ``0x80`` - ``0xbf`` (64 bytes): currently allocated memory size (aka. free memory pointer)
- ``0xc0`` - ``0xff`` (64 bytes): zero slot

Scratch space can be used between statements (i.e. within inline assembly). The zero slot
is used as initial value for dynamic memory arrays and should never be written to
(the free memory pointer points to ``0x100`` initially).

Hyperion always places new objects at the free memory pointer and
memory is never freed (this might change in the future).

Elements in memory arrays in Hyperion always occupy multiples of 64 bytes (this
is even true for ``bytes1[]``, but not for ``bytes`` and ``string``).
Multi-dimensional memory arrays are pointers to memory arrays. The length of a
dynamic array is stored at the first slot of the array and followed by the array
elements.

.. warning::
  There are some operations in Hyperion that need a temporary memory area
  larger than 64 bytes and therefore will not fit into the scratch space.
  They will be placed where the free memory points to, but given their
  short lifetime, the pointer is not updated. The memory may or may not
  be zeroed out. Because of this, one should not expect the free memory
  to point to zeroed out memory.

  While it may seem like a good idea to use ``msize`` to arrive at a
  definitely zeroed out memory area, using such a pointer non-temporarily
  without updating the free memory pointer can have unexpected results.


Differences to Layout in Storage
================================

As described above the layout in memory is different from the layout in
:ref:`storage<storage-inplace-encoding>`. Below there are some examples.

Example for Difference in Arrays
--------------------------------

The following array occupies 64 bytes (1 slot) in storage, but 256
bytes (4 items with 64 bytes each) in memory.

.. code-block:: hyperion

    uint8[4] a;



Example for Difference in Struct Layout
---------------------------------------

The following struct occupies 192 bytes (3 slots of 64 bytes) in storage,
but 256 bytes (4 items with 64 bytes each) in memory.


.. code-block:: hyperion

    struct S {
        uint a;
        uint b;
        uint8 c;
        uint8 d;
    }
